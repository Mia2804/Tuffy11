APP

There was a separate APP page.

Instead- lets have the app icon on every page

That link would take them to website to download app from various app stores.
Google play and iTunes 

The APP would have Tuffy Tiger APP icon.

Gallery 
For now, we will have images of Tuffy Tiger but as we get more popular or as I get kids to do things, kids can email images of the crafts they made via the website and tuffy will post them to his gallery.

The gallery should be called “Tuffy’s Gallery” 
There should be a small link under the images stating “Submit your images to Tuffy” 
Im sure we will get naughty things LOL but I think having the kids see their work online would be great!
