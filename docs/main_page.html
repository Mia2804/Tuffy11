Thank you for your email

We are excited about our new Tuffy Tiger program that we are using in public schools.

But teachers are asking for resources to use when we are not in the classroom itself.

So we are looking to create a website.

We currently have a website for our charity- but it uses iWeb which is no longer viable.

Our website is supported by Tierra Net and we have tons and tons of space for everything we need to do.

Now, we are not tech folk. We are teachers and performers that volunteer for at-risk kids.

We do not pretend to know or even sometimes understand tech stuff.

BUT we do what we can. 

We have a mobile web-app that will be hosted via our website/Tierra Net. You can view a screen shot here:

Attached to this email is a sketch of the layout/design idea we had I’m mind
AND
A rough design highlighting ideas from the sketch.

We want the website’s colors etc to copy the mobile app so there is consistency.

We have music, images, logos, and text alllllll ready.

Videos and games for the site are being completed now.
The videos and games will be provided in multiple formats.
You need not make any games or videos, you would simply place them in the site.

We have sketches for each page on the site as well but most of them mimic the “new doc” idea

We did find sproutonline.com as our inspiration. The site needs to be FUN and SOFT/COMFORTABL
